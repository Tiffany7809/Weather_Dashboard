# Weather_Dashboard

The goal of this project is tp create an interactive weather dashboard.
Users should be able to enter their preferred city, and recieve a display of the current weather int hat city for the next five days.
Users should be able to create a favorites list of cities that they can compile and maintain over page loads.
When the user views the UV index, the color should corespond with if conditions are favorable, dangerous, or moderate.

this project was a really hard one for me, I had a lot to learn in regards to using Fetch calls and media queries.

I learned how to pull information from a database, and display is on the web page.
I gained the beginnings of an understanding of media queries.
